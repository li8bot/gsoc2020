## Ideas List

1. Integrating Tensorflow 2.0 support for Transfer Learning based Image Classification

**Source Code :**
[Monk Image Classification](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/monk_v1)

**Project Description :**
Add a low-code wrapper over tensorflow-2.0 as per monk repository's coding standards and backend formats. Goal is to replicate all the modules present in monk's backends (pytorch, keras and mxnet) and create a new one to enable transfer learning and general image classification using tensorflow2.0 backend. 


**Objectives :** 
- Pull Monk repository and test in a local setup
- Run all the examples present in each backend.
- Go through Documentation and understand the syntax, implementation modules and pipelines.
- Understand folder and directory sturcture for codes for keras backend.
- Understand different modes of operation in available backends
    - quick mode
    - update mode
    - expert mode
    - switch mode
- Understand how metrics are being saved and used in comparison mode
- Understand working of hyper-parameter finders 
- Understand how custom network builder works in different backends.
- Create wrappers overs
    - pretrained model loaders
    - data loaders for single label and multi label classification
    - Nural network layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers and learning rate schedulers
    - data-transformation functions
- Replicate modes as present in rest of the backends
    - quick mode
    - update mode
    - expert mode
    - switch mode
- Create hyper-parameter fiinder module with tf-2.0 backend
- Create custom network builder
- Write examples similat to the ones existing with the other backends in monk repository

2. Creating Object Detection workflows across different imaging modalities

**Source Code :**
[Monk Object Detection](https://github.com/Tessellate-Imaging/Monk_Object_Detection)

**Project Description :**
Explore state of the art Object Detection research implementations for :
1) Thermal Imagery
2) Multispectral Satellite Imagery
3) Biomedical Imagery
4) Document Imagery
5) 

and create a high level wrapper using Monk's syntax.

**Objectives :**

- Pull Monk Object Detection repository and test in a local setup
- Go through Documentation and understand the syntax, implementation modules and pipelines.
- Explore state of the art algorithms and applications on different imaging modalities
- Create 10 workflows ( 2 for each imaging modality )
- Build unit tests for setting up Monk locally
